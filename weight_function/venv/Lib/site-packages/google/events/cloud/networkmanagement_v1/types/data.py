        Values:
            CAUSE_UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Cause is unspecified.
            UNKNOWN_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS (1):
                Destination external address cannot be
                resolved to a known target. If the address is
                used in a Google Cloud project, provide the
                project ID as test input.
            FOREIGN_IP_DISALLOWED (2):
                A Compute Engine instance can only send or receive a packet
                with a foreign IP address if ip_forward is enabled.
            FIREWALL_RULE (3):
                Dropped due to a firewall rule, unless
                allowed due to connection tracking.
            NO_ROUTE (4):
                Dropped due to no routes.
            ROUTE_BLACKHOLE (5):
                Dropped due to invalid route. Route's next
                hop is a blackhole.
            ROUTE_WRONG_NETWORK (6):
                Packet is sent to a wrong (unintended)
                network. Example: you trace a packet from
                VM1:Network1 to VM2:Network2, however, the route
                configured in Network1 sends the packet destined
                for VM2's IP addresss to Network3.
            PRIVATE_TRAFFIC_TO_INTERNET (7):
                Packet with internal destination address sent
                to the internet gateway.
            PRIVATE_GOOGLE_ACCESS_DISALLOWED (8):
                Instance with only an internal IP address
                tries to access Google API and services, but
                private Google access is not enabled.
            NO_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS (9):
                Instance with only an internal IP address
                tries to access external hosts, but Cloud NAT is
                not enabled in the subnet, unless special
                configurations on a VM allow this connection.
            UNKNOWN_INTERNAL_ADDRESS (10):
                Destination internal address cannot be
                resolved to a known target. If this is a shared
                VPC scenario, verify if the service project ID
                is provided as test input. Otherwise, verify if
                the IP address is being used in the project.
            FORWARDING_RULE_MISMATCH (11):
                Forwarding rule's protocol and ports do not
                match the packet header.
            FORWARDING_RULE_REGION_MISMATCH (25):
                Packet could be dropped because it was sent
                from a different region to a regional forwarding
                without global access.
            FORWARDING_RULE_NO_INSTANCES (12):
                Forwarding rule does not have backends
                configured.
            FIREWALL_BLOCKING_LOAD_BALANCER_BACKEND_HEALTH_CHECK (13):
                Firewalls block the health check probes to the backends and
                cause the backends to be unavailable for traffic from the
                load balancer. For more details, see `Health check firewall
                rules <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-checks#firewall_rules>`__.
            INSTANCE_NOT_RUNNING (14):
                Packet is sent from or to a Compute Engine
                instance that is not in a running state.
            GKE_CLUSTER_NOT_RUNNING (27):
                Packet sent from or to a GKE cluster that is
                not in running state.
            CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_NOT_RUNNING (28):
                Packet sent from or to a Cloud SQL instance
                that is not in running state.
            TRAFFIC_TYPE_BLOCKED (15):
                The type of traffic is blocked and the user cannot configure
                a firewall rule to enable it. See `Always blocked
                traffic <https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls#blockedtraffic>`__
                for more details.
            GKE_MASTER_UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS (16):

                See `Authorizing with authorized
                networks <https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/authorize-networks>`__

            GOOGLE_MANAGED_SERVICE_NO_PSC_ENDPOINT (38):
                Packet was dropped because the Google-managed
                service uses Private Service Connect (PSC), but
                the PSC endpoint is not found in the project.
            GKE_PSC_ENDPOINT_MISSING (36):
                Packet was dropped because the GKE cluster
                uses Private Service Connect (PSC), but the PSC
                endpoint is not found in the project.
            CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_NO_IP_ADDRESS (21):
                Packet was dropped because the Cloud SQL

                address.
            GKE_CONTROL_PLANE_REGION_MISMATCH (30):

                destination network.

                Packet sent from a Cloud SQL instance to an
                external IP address is not allowed. The Cloud
                SQL instance is not configured to send packets
                to external IP addresses.
            PUBLIC_CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_TO_PRIVATE_DESTINATION (34):

                address.
            CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_NO_ROUTE (35):
                Packet was dropped because there is no route

                network.
            CLOUD_FUNCTION_NOT_ACTIVE (22):
                Packet could be dropped because the Cloud
                Function is not in an active status.
            VPC_CONNECTOR_NOT_SET (23):
                Packet could be dropped because no VPC
                connector is set.
            VPC_CONNECTOR_NOT_RUNNING (24):
                Packet could be dropped because the VPC

            location.

            Examples:

            If the source IP address is an internal IP
            address within a Google Cloud Virtual Private
            Cloud (VPC) network, then you must also specify
            the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM
            instance, which already contains its internal IP
            address and VPC network information.

            If the source of the test is within an
            on-premises network, then you must provide the
            destination VPC network.

            If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM
            instance with multiple network interfaces, the
            instance itself is not sufficient to identify
            the endpoint. So, you must also specify the
            source IP address or VPC network.

            A reachability analysis proceeds even if the
            source location is ambiguous. However, the test
            result may include endpoints that you don't
            intend to test.
        destination (google.events.cloud.networkmanagement_v1.types.Endpoint):
            Required. Destination specification of the
            Connectivity Test.
            You can use a combination of destination IP
            address, Compute Engine VM instance, or VPC
            network to uniquely identify the destination
            location.

            Even if the destination IP address is not
            unique, the source IP location is unique.
            Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
            endpoint from route information.

            If the destination you specify is a VM instance
            and the instance has multiple network
            interfaces, then you must also specify either a
            destination IP address  or VPC network to
            identify the destination interface.

            A reachability analysis proceeds even if the
            destination location is ambiguous. However, the
            result can include endpoints that you don't
            intend to test.
        protocol (str):
            IP Protocol of the test. When not provided,
            "TCP" is assumed.
        related_projects (MutableSequence[str]):
            Other projects that may be relevant for
            reachability analysis. This is applicable to
            scenarios where a test can cross project
            boundaries.
        display_name (str):
            Output only. The display name of a
            Connectivity Test.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Resource labels to represent user-provided
            metadata.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time the test was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):

            Output only. The reachability details of this
            test from the latest run. The details are
