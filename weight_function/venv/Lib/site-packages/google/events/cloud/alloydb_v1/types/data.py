            the flag. These flags are passed at instance setup time, so
            include both server options and system variables for

            Read pool specific config.

            -  projects/{project}/locations/{region}/backups/{backup_id}
               where the cluster and backup ID segments should satisfy

               or number. For more details see

        display_name (str):
            User-settable and human-readable display name
            for the Backup.
        uid (str):
            Output only. The system-generated UID of the

            Output only. Reconciling
            (https://google.aip.dev/128#reconciliation), if
            true, indicates that the service is actively
            updating the resource. This can happen due to

            this field is not specified, the backup will

            Output only. The time at which after the backup is eligible
            to be garbage collected. It is the duration specified by the
