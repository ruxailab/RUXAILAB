            Backup resource was created manually by a user
            or via a schedule in the BackupPlan. A value of

            A set of custom labels supplied by user.
        delete_lock_days (int):
            Minimum age for this Backup (in days). If this field is set

            deletion (either manual or automatic deletion) for the

            The age (in days) after which this Backup will be

            -  If 0, no automatic deletion will occur for this Backup.

            value.
        cluster_metadata (google.events.cloud.gkebackup_v1.types.Backup.ClusterMetadata):
            Output only. Information about the GKE
            cluster from which this Backup was created.

            sizes)
        etag (str):

            control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a
            backup from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested
            that systems make use of the ``etag`` in the
            read-modify-write cycle to perform backup updates in order
            to avoid race conditions: An ``etag`` is returned in the
            response to ``GetBackup``, and systems are expected to put
            that etag in the request to ``UpdateBackup`` or
            ``DeleteBackup`` to ensure that their change will be applied
            to the same version of the resource.
        description (str):
            User specified descriptive string for this
            Backup.
