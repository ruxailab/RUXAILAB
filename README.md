<a href='https://youtu.be/dAf4LRxITCc'>Tutorial - Running RUXAILAB with Firebase Emulators   üñ•Ô∏è</a>

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the development environment and run the application locally:

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   pip install
   ```
 Open Firebase / Firestore and start a project.

   - In the project dashboard, click on the settings button on the left side of the screen (gear icon).
  - In the project settings, under the general tab, scroll down to the end of the screen, you should find the following screen. 
<div align="center">
  <img src="public/FBexample.png" alt="FBexample" height="450" />
</div> 

In the folder of your project, create a file with the name .env and put the following data:

  ```javascript
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_DB_URL=""
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=""
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=""


  // Doesn't need changes
  VUE_APP_I18N_LOCALE="en"
  VUE_APP_I18N_FALLBACK_LOCALE="en"
  ```
Then, complete the information in your .env file with the firebase information, respectively in their fields, and run:


  ```bash
   # Run the application locally
   npm run serve
   ```
## Running with Firebase Emulators 
- Add ```firebase.json``` file with the following code snippet:

```javascript
    {
  "firestore": {
    "rules": "firestore.rules",
    "indexes": "firestore.indexes.json"
  },
  "functions": [
    {
      "predeploy": ["npm --prefix \"$RESOURCE_DIR\" run lint"],
      "source": "functions",
      "codebase": "functions"
    },
    {
      "source": "weight_function",
      "codebase": "weight_function",
      "ignore": ["venv", ".git", "firebase-debug.log", "firebase-debug.*.log"]
    }
  ],
  "hosting": {
    "site": "ruxailab-dev",
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  },
  "emulators": {
    "auth": {
      "port": 9099
    },
    "functions": {
      "port": 5001
    },
    "firestore": {
      "port": 8081
    },
    "hosting": {
      "port": 5000
    },
    "ui": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "singleProjectMode": true,
    "storage": {
      "port": 9199
    }
  },
  "storage": {
    "rules": "storage.rules"
  }
}
	
```
Setup your Firebase Emulators

Run:

```bash

firebase use (choose your option)
firebase emulators:start

```

## Running Python Function 

To calculate heuristic weights, run:

 ```bash	
 # Run locally
  firebase init functions
  firebase use (choose your option)
  firebase emulators:start --only functions
   ```
Then get the url, go to the .env file and add the following sentence:

  ```javascript
    // Your previous code
   VUE_APP_FIREBASE_PYTHON_FUNCTION="url"
   ```

If you want to deply the fuction, change your account from spark to blaze, run:

 ```bash	
    firebase deploy --only functions
   ```
Go to firebase panel -> functions -> on the right side of the function press "detailed usage statistics".
There you can get the url and replace on .env file.
