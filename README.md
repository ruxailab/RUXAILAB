   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   pip install
   ```

</div>

### Retrieve Database URL from Firebase Realtime Database

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Select your project.
3. In the left-hand menu, click on "Realtime Database."
4. The Database URL will be displayed in the top-right corner of the Realtime Database section. Copy this URL.

In the folder of your project, create a file with the name `.env` and put the following data:

  ```javascript
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_DB_URL="PASTE_YOUR_DATABASE_URL_HERE"
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=""
  VUE_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=""

  // Doesn't need changes
  VUE_APP_I18N_LOCALE="en"
  VUE_APP_I18N_FALLBACK_LOCALE="en"
  ```
Then, complete the information in your `.env` file with the Firebase details and run:

  ```bash
   # Run the application locally
   npm run serve
   ```

## Running with Firebase Emulators

- Add `firebase.json` file with the following code snippet:

```javascript
{
  "firestore": {
    "rules": "firestore.rules",
    "indexes": "firestore.indexes.json"
  },
  "functions": [
    {
      "predeploy": ["npm --prefix \"$RESOURCE_DIR\" run lint"],
      "source": "functions",
      "codebase": "functions"
    }
  ],
  "hosting": {
    "site": "ruxailab-dev",
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  },
  "emulators": {
    "auth": {
      "port": 9099
    },
    "functions": {
      "port": 5001
    },
    "firestore": {
      "port": 8081
    },
    "hosting": {
      "port": 5000
